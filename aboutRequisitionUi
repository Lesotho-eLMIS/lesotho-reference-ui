Built a new lesothoelmis-requisition-ui image on 10th Dec 2025.
The lesothoelmis-reference-ui is now using this requisition image entirely
hence why there are no requisition files in the lesotho reference-ui src folder
exept the requisition redistribution which is a newly introduced feature in the 
lesotho elmis ui.
This convention is worthy of note for future reference since all other ui components 
like fulfilment and stock management do not use this image convention.
